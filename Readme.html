        <h1>A clock for your Model Railway</h1>
        <p>
            An HTML Canvas clock, based on
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_clock_start.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_clock_start.asp</a>
            which accelerates in the periods where no train is running.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>How it works...</p>

        <p>To set up the clock, you need to create a timetable, to 
        tell the clock when to go at normal time and when to run fast.</p>

        <p>This goes in a &lt;script&gt; block at the top of your HTML page.</p>

        <p>e.g.<pre>
    var timetable = [
        ['09:00:00', '09:05:00'], 
        ['10:30:00', '10:33:00']
    ];</pre></p>

        <p>When the page loads, a lost of the "slow-down" and "speed-up"
        times is calculated, along with the offset between real-world-time
        and the time your timetable starts at.</p>

        <p>When the clock reaches a "speeding up" time, it will run fast until
        the next time entr is reached. In the example above, the clock will
        run fast between 09:05:00 and 10:30:00</p>

        <p>// Start times may need to be adjusted to cater for accelerated clock time.
        e.g. start 15s before you need to.
        TODO: work out what to say about the end-end time.
        e.g. add a 4-hour run-off block? or will the clock stop?
        The time when the clock slows down may be a while after the stated time
        because the clock needs to slow down. (about 20-30s with current settings)</p>

        <h2>Technical Notes</h2>

        <p>
            There are zillions of other Javascript clocks out there. Here are some I like the look of:

                    8 different JS clocks reviewed</li>
                <li>Now that <tt>ClockMechanism</tt> is reporting Milliseconds, it should be possible to create
                    a Mondaine clock. Each second the second hand moves 1.5/60 of a circle further than it would
                    on a normal clock, and pauses for 1.5s when it reaches 60s.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            It's OK to redraw the canvas all the time (see
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7365436/erasing-previously-drawn-lines-on-an-html5-canvas"
            >this stack overflow</a>), unless doing so results in a massive performance it (see
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805705/is-it-asking-too-much-of-canvas-to-redraw-everything-inside-of-the-game-loop"
            ><i>this</i> stack overflow</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            window.requestAnimationFrame() is a bit like window.setInterval() or window.setTimeout(), except it repeatedly
            calls your function at the refresh rate (e.g. 60 times a second)
        </p>

        <h2>To Do</h2>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get the window size to draw the clock full-screen.
                (currently hard-coded in the HTML)</li>
                
            <li>make sure the timetable is chronological</li>

        </ul>
